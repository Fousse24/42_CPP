# 42_CPP
This is a collection of C++ projects exploring many aspects of object-oriented programming.<br>
What is learned is each module is normally re-used in the ones after, and the last exercise is often a summation of what came before.
<br>

For a more advanced project about creating containers in C++, you can go to my other <a href="https://github.com/Fousse24/container">repository</a>.

### Notable exercises
- [Claptrap](CPP03/ex03) (Inheritance and Diamond problem)
