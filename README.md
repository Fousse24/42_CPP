# 42_CPP
This is a collection of C++ projects exploring many aspects of object-oriented programming.<br>
What is learned is each module is normally re-used in the ones after, and the last exercise is often a summation of what came before.

For a more advanced project about creating containers in C++, you can go to my other <a href="https://github.com/Fousse24/container">repository</a>.

### Notable exercises
- [Claptrap](CPP03/ex03) (Inheritance and Diamond problem)
- [AMateria](CPP04/ex03) (Object Factory, Interfaces/Abstract classes)
- [Intern](CPP05/ex03) (Exceptions and everything else)

### CPP00
This one is mainly to help transition our C habits and knowledge to C++. So using C++ functions rather than C when possible!

### CPP01
  - Memory allocation
  - Reference and pointers to members
  - Usage of the switch in CPP

### CPP02
  - Ad-hoc polymorphism
  - Overloads
  - Orthodox canonical classes
 
### CPP03
  - Inheritance;
  - "<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/diamond_problem">Diamond</a>" problem
 
### CPP04
  - Subtype polymorphism
  - Abstract classes / interfaces

### CPP05
  - Try/Catch
  - Creating custom exceptions

### CPP06
  - static_cast
  - reinterpret_cast
  - dynamic_cast

### CPP07
  - Templates
    1. functions
    2. mock iterator
    3. custom class template Array

### CPP08
  - Templates
    1. Function taking a templated container
    2. Create a templated Span container with some functions
    3. Create a templated MutantStack which inherit std::stack
    
### Final C++ project : [ft_containers](https://github.com/Fousse24/container)
In depth exploration of templates and std::containers.
